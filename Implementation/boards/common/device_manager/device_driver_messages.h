 * @brief SensWear device-manager message contract.
 *
 * @defgroup senswear_device_driver_messages SensWear device driver messages
 * @ingroup io_interfaces
 * @{
 *
 * This header defines the decoded data structures the SensWear device manager
 * publishes for the rest of the application to consume (for example over zbus).
 * It is the stable *contract* between the device manager and its subscribers
 * (the BLE manager, storage/logging, app logic, LED/haptic feedback, ...): a
 * subscriber depends only on these types, never on the individual device
 * drivers.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_messages_design Design
 *
 * The message types are **self-contained plain-old-data**: they intentionally do
 * @b not include any device-driver header, and they flatten each driver's decoded
 * sample into stable fields with explicit units. Two consequences follow:
 *
 * - The contract compiles regardless of which board drivers or shield is
 *   selected, so it can be shared by every subscriber without pulling in
 *   driver code.
 * - The device manager is the single place that translates a driver's native
 *   sample struct (e.g. `struct touch_sensor_sample_t`, `struct
 *   max30101_ppg_sample_t`) into the message below and publishes it @b by @b
 *   value. Only the device manager includes both the driver headers and this
 *   contract; when the device manager is disabled (for isolated device or shield
 *   tests) nothing else references it.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_messages_time Timestamps
 *
 * Every message carries a @c timestamp in **microseconds since the Unix epoch**.
 * Some devices report a device-local time base instead (the BHI360, for example,
 * timestamps relative to sensor-hub firmware boot); normalizing those to the
 * common epoch is the device manager's responsibility, so subscribers can treat
 * all timestamps uniformly.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_messages_channels Channels
 *
 * This header defines only the payloads. How they are carried is a device-manager
 * decision: either one channel per data type (each message struct is the channel
 * message), or one channel carrying the tagged ::device_msg_t envelope. The
 * per-type structs and the envelope are both provided so that choice can be made
 * (and revisited) in the device manager without changing the contract.
 *
 * The @c device_id field carries the producing device's generated
 * `<LABEL>_DEVICE_ID` (see @ref senswear_device_driver_events). It is a
 * build-time identifier, not a stable ABI value; never persist it off-device.
