 * A stream carries exactly one message type, so a subscriber observes only the
 * data it cares about; filtering is the framework's job, not the consumer's.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_manager_subscribe Subscribing to a stream
 *
 * Consumers register themselves as zbus observers of the streams they want once
 * the producing device is ready (typically after it has been configured). For a
 * queued, own-thread consumer (recommended for the BLE manager and storage):
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_DEFINE(my_sub);
 * ret = device_manager_stream_register(device_manager_stream_TouchGesture,
 *                                      &my_sub,
 *                                      K_MSEC(100));
 *
 * const struct zbus_channel *chan;
 * while (!zbus_sub_wait_msg(&my_sub, &chan, &msg, K_FOREVER)) {
 *     if (device_manager_stream_from_channel(chan) == device_manager_stream_TouchGesture) {
 *         const struct touch_gesture_msg_t *g = &msg;
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * For a cheap synchronous reaction (LED / haptic feedback) use a listener
 * instead; note listeners run in the publisher's (device-manager) context, so
 * they must not block.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_manager_lifecycle Lifecycle
 *
 * device_manager_init() runs each available device's driver init but does not
 * start any thread. device_manager_start() then spawns the manager's consumer
 * thread, which drains the shared @ref senswear_device_driver_events queue,
 * drives each device's interrupt handler, and publishes decoded messages onto
 * the streams. The whole module is gated by @c CONFIG_SENSWEAR_DEVICE_MANAGER,
 * so it is absent from isolated device/shield test images.
