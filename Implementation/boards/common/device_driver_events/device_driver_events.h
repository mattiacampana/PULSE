 *
 * Many SensWear devices (charger, fuel gauge, IMU, daughter board, ...) signal
 * asynchronous activity from interrupt handlers. Rather than giving each device
 * its own thread, they all publish into one shared event queue that a single
 * consumer thread drains and dispatches. This keeps device-event handling in one
 * place, in thread context, and on one stack.

 * @section senswear_device_driver_events_model Ownership model
 *
 * Events are delivered @b by @b value: device_driver_event_wait() copies the next event
 * into a caller-provided ::device_driver_event_t. There is no allocation to release and
 * no internal pointer is exposed. The copy is valid for as long as the caller's
 * buffer lives, so a synchronous consumer can simply keep it on its stack.
 *
 * The @ref device_driver_event_t.p_param pointer is copied verbatim; the memory it
 * points at is @b not copied. A producer must therefore point @ref
 * device_driver_event_t.p_param at storage that remains valid until the consumer has
 * processed the event (for example a device's static context). Transient stack
 * buffers must not be passed through @ref device_driver_event_t.p_param. Small payloads
 * should be carried inline in @ref device_driver_event_t.v_param instead.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_events_context Execution context
 *
 * Producers may run in either thread or interrupt context:
 * - device_driver_event_post() is for thread context.
 * - device_driver_event_post_isr() is for interrupt context and never blocks.
 *
 * device_driver_event_wait() blocks and must only be called from a thread. The design
 * assumes exactly one consumer thread; the queue is otherwise multi-producer and
 * thread-/ISR-safe.
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_events_ids Device identifiers
 *
 * The @ref device_driver_event_t.device_id values come from @c device_driver_dts_ids.h,
 * which is @b generated at build time from the merged Zephyr devicetree by
 * @c generate_device_driver_ids.py (wired up in @c common_drivers.cmake). The generator
 * runs at CMake @e configure time against @c build/.../zephyr/zephyr.dts, which
 * @c find_package(Zephyr) has already produced, so the header has DTS-derived content
 * before any source is compiled. Because the devicetree sources are configure
 * dependencies of the Zephyr build, any devicetree change triggers a reconfigure that
 * regenerates the header.
 *
 * The generator walks the merged DTS in node order and emits one macro per node that is
 * @b labeled, has a @c compatible property, and is not @c status @c = @c "disabled".
 * For a node label @c foo the macro is named @c FOO_DEVICE_ID: the label is upper-cased
 * and every non-alphanumeric character is replaced with an underscore. IDs are assigned
 * sequentially starting at @c 1u in DTS order; @c DEVICE_ID_INVALID is @c 0u and
 * @c SENSWEAR_GENERATED_DEVICE_COUNT holds the total. For example a DTS node
 * @c sys_spi:&nbsp;spi&nbsp;{&nbsp;compatible&nbsp;=&nbsp;"...";&nbsp;} yields
 * @c SYS_SPI_DEVICE_ID.
 *
 * @warning These IDs are @b build-time identifiers, not a stable ABI. Because they are
 * positional in the merged DTS, adding, removing, reordering, or enabling/disabling a
 * node can shift the value of every following ID. Always refer to a device by its
 * generated @c <LABEL>_DEVICE_ID macro; never hard-code the numeric value and never
 * persist it off-device (for example in stored records or wire protocols).
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_events_lifecycle Lifecycle
 *
 * device_driver_event_init() must be called once during start-up to create the backing
 * queue before any event is posted or awaited. device_driver_event_get_queue() exposes
 * the underlying Zephyr message queue for advanced integration (for example
 * adding it to a @c k_poll set).
 *
 * @section senswear_device_driver_events_example Typical usage
 *
 * Initialization, once at start-up (automatic if CONFIG_SENSWEAR_DEVICE_DRIVER_EVENTS_AUTO_INIT is
 * enabled):
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * device_driver_event_init(CONFIG_SENSWEAR_DEVICE_DRIVER_EVENTS_MAX);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Producer side, from a device's deferred interrupt handler:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * #define DEV_CHARGER 1u
 * #define CHG_EVT_IRQ 1u
 *
 * // From a work handler (thread context):
 * device_driver_event_post(DEV_CHARGER, CHG_EVT_IRQ, raw_status, NULL);
 *
 * // Or directly from an ISR:
 * device_driver_event_post_isr(DEV_CHARGER, CHG_EVT_IRQ, 0u, NULL);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Consumer side, the single device-manager thread:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * static void device_manager_thread(void *a, void *b, void *c)
 * {
 *     struct device_driver_event_t ev;          // lives on this thread's stack
 *
 *     while (device_driver_event_wait(K_FOREVER, &ev)) {
 *         switch (ev.device_id) {
 *         case DEV_CHARGER:
 *             charger_handle_event(&ev);
 *             break;
 *         default:
 *             break;
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * @endcode
