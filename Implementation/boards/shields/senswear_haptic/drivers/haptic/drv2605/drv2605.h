/**
 * @file
 * @brief API for the SensWear-patched DRV2605 haptic driver.
 * @ingroup drv2605_interface
 *
 * @details
 * This is a vendored copy of Zephyr's DRV2605 haptics driver, patched for the
 * SensWear platform so it can be changed without modifying the installed NCS
 * tree. The companion source is `drv2605.c`; the provenance, baseline, and the
 * full list of local changes are tracked in `PATCHED_FROM_ZEPHYR.md` next to
 * this file. Keep that file and this block in sync when patching.
 *
 * @par Provenance
 * - Baseline: NCS `v3.3.0` / Zephyr `4.3.99`
 *   (`/Users/yusein/Tools/nordic/ncs/v3.3.0/zephyr`).
 * - Copied from `zephyr/{drivers/haptics/drv2605.c,
 *   include/zephyr/drivers/haptics/drv2605.h, drivers/haptics/Kconfig.drv2605,
 *   dts/bindings/haptics/ti,drv2605.yaml}`.
 * - Zephyr's original copyright and SPDX headers are preserved.
 *
 * @par What is patched (vs. the Zephyr baseline)
 * - @b Compatible: binds to the namespaced `senswear,drv2605`
 *   (`DT_DRV_COMPAT senswear_drv2605`) instead of `ti,drv2605`, so it replaces,
 *   rather than collides with, Zephyr's upstream driver, binding, and
 *   `HAPTICS_DRV2605` Kconfig symbol. The driver is built when
 *   `CONFIG_SENSWEAR_DRV2605_DRIVER` is set.
 * - @b Bus: register access is routed through the SensWear `sys_i2c` ownership
 *   wrapper (`sys_i2c_write` / `sys_i2c_write_read`, `sys_i2c_lock` /
 *   `sys_i2c_release`) instead of the direct `i2c_dt_spec` helpers. Every
 *   dev-level operation acquires bus ownership on entry and fully releases it
 *   before returning.
 * - @b Enable @b pin: no devicetree `en-gpios`. The enable line is mandatory and
 *   claimed at init from the daughter-board GPIO arbiter as `daughter_if_GPIO0`;
 *   if that line is already owned the driver logs an error and asserts. The pin
 *   is held for the device's lifetime.
 * - @b RTP @b lifecycle: per-device atomic state (`rtp_active`,
 *   `rtp_stop_requested`, `rtp_active_seconds`). A second RTP start is rejected
 *   with `-EBUSY`; an external stop is observed mid-stream; a duplicate
 *   `Stopped` event is suppressed when the worker will post it.
 * - @b Events: playback lifecycle is reported through the SensWear device-driver
 *   event queue under `DRV2605_DEVICE_DTS_ID`; see @ref drv2605_event_type.
 * - @b Supply: the `vin-supply` regulator is owned by the driver and cached on
 *   the device object. The board rail is driven at a fixed 3.6 V; it is
 *   validated at init, set and enabled when output starts, and disabled on
 *   power-manager turn-off. See @ref drv2605_supply "Supply rail".
 *
 * @par Features
 * - Zephyr haptics device API (`haptics_start_output()` /
 *   `haptics_stop_output()`) for start/stop.
 * - Five signal sources via drv2605_haptic_config(): ROM library waveforms, RTP
 *   streaming, audio-to-vibe, PWM, and analog (see @ref drv2605_haptics_source).
 * - Asynchronous RTP playback on a work queue; the caller's RTP buffers are
 *   streamed directly and must outlive playback. drv2605_rtp_is_active() lets a
 *   buffer owner serialise patterns and avoid reusing buffers mid-stream.
 * - Lifecycle/observability events (`Starting`, `Stopped`, `PlaybackActive`,
 *   `Error`) with a once-per-second active heartbeat; drv2605_event_name()
 *   returns printable names.
 * - Closed-loop LRA auto-resonance with per-actuator calibration during init.
 * - Driver-owned supply rail at a fixed 3.6 V (see @ref drv2605_supply).
 * - Power management hooks: suspend/resume toggle the standby bit, turn-on
 *   raises the enable pin, and turn-off lowers the enable pin and disables the
 *   supply rail.
 *
 * @anchor drv2605_supply
 * @par Supply rail
 * The DRV2605 input rail (`VDD`) is driven from the regulator named by the
 * devicetree `vin-supply` phandle (on SensWear the shared daughter-connector
 * rail, `VDD_DAUGHTER` from the TPSM83102). The driver takes ownership of that
 * regulator rather than relying on an external power policy:
 * - @b Configured @b voltage: a fixed 3.6 V (`DRV2605_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_UV`,
 *   3600000 microvolts). This is the driver IC supply, not the actuator drive
 *   voltage; the latter is bounded separately by the rated and clamp registers.
 * - @b Init: the regulator handle is resolved from devicetree and cached on the
 *   device object. Initialization sets the rail to 3.6 V, enables it, and waits
 *   for it to settle before probing and calibrating the part. If the shared rail
 *   is already enabled, init requires it to already sit at 3.6 V and fails with
 *   `-EINVAL` otherwise.
 * - @b Start: each `haptics_start_output()` idempotently ensures that the rail
 *   remains enabled. A rail this driver already brought up is left untouched.
 * - @b Turn-off: `PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_OFF` disables the rail, but only if this
 *   driver was the one that enabled it.
 * - @b No @b regulator: if `vin-supply` is absent the driver treats the rail as
 *   externally managed and performs no regulator operations.
 *
 * @note The regulator transport itself locks the shared SYS_I2C bus, so all
 * supply operations run outside the device's own bus-ownership scope.
 *
 * @par Typical use case (RTP playback)
 * @code{.c}
 * // Device comes from the devicetree node bound to "senswear,drv2605".
 * const struct device *dev = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_ALIAS(senswear_haptic));
 *
 * if (!device_is_ready(dev)) {
 *         return -ENODEV;
 * }
 *
 * // Buffers must stay valid for the whole async stream; keep them static or
 * // otherwise owned until playback finishes.
 * static uint32_t hold_us[]  = { 100000, 50000, 100000 }; // per-frame hold time
 * static uint8_t  input[]    = {    255,   128,      0  }; // per-frame amplitude
 * static struct drv2605_rtp_data rtp = {
 *         .size        = ARRAY_SIZE(input),
 *         .rtp_hold_us = hold_us,
 *         .rtp_input   = input,
 * };
 * const union drv2605_config_data cfg = { .rtp_data = &rtp };
 *
 * if (drv2605_rtp_is_active(dev)) {
 *         return -EBUSY;            // a previous pattern is still streaming
 * }
 *
 * int ret = drv2605_haptic_config(dev, DRV2605_HAPTICS_SOURCE_RTP, &cfg);
 * if (ret == 0) {
 *         ret = haptics_start_output(dev);  // returns immediately; plays async
 * }
 * // ... later, to abort early:
 * // haptics_stop_output(dev);
 * @endcode
 *
 * For ROM library playback, populate a @ref drv2605_rom_data instead and pass it
 * through @ref union drv2605_config_data::rom_data with
 * @ref DRV2605_HAPTICS_SOURCE_ROM, then call haptics_start_output().
