 *
 * @defgroup senswear_max30101 SensWear MAX30101 PPG sensor
 * @ingroup io_interfaces
 * @{
 *
 * The MAX30101 is the optical front end on the SensWear PPG daughter board. It
 * drives Red, IR, and Green LEDs and streams photoplethysmography samples through
 * an internal FIFO. This driver probes the part, programs its acquisition
 * configuration, drains the FIFO, and turns hardware interrupt conditions into
 * stable software events for higher-level policy code.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30101_timestamp_semantics Timestamp semantics
 *
 * The MAX30101 FIFO records do not carry a Unix epoch timestamp. The driver
 * captures the interrupt arrival time with rtc_get_timestamp_us() and uses that
 * as the batch anchor when draining the FIFO. Each decoded PPG sample is then
 * assigned an interpolated timestamp in microseconds since the Unix epoch based
 * on the configured sampling rate.
 *
 * Like the other SensWear board drivers, the MAX30101 routes every transfer
 * through the board's @ref senswear_sys_i2c ownership wrapper rather than
 * calling Zephyr's I2C API directly:
 *
 * @code{.text}
 * application / PPG bridge
 *          |
 *          | max30101_config(), max30101_irq_handler(), max30101_enable_sampling(), ...

 *          v
 * SensWear shared system I2C bus
 * @endcode
 *
 * Every high-level hardware operation acquires the shared bus once and calls
 * sys_i2c_release() on exit. Private register helpers assume that ownership has
 * already been acquired.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30101_devicetree Devicetree representation
 *
 * The sensor is a standard I2C child of the shared system bus, declared by the
 * `senswear_ppg` shield overlay:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * &sys_i2c_peripheral {
 *     max30101: max30101@57 {
 *         compatible = "senswear,daughter-i2c-device", "i2c-device";
 *         reg = <0x57>;
 *         label = "MAX30101";
 *         status = "okay";
 *         vin-supply = <&tpsm83102>;
 *     };
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * The node is also wired into the board aliases `senswear-daughter` and
 * `senswear-ppg`, both pointing at this instance.
 *
 * `reg` supplies the target address used by SYS_I2C_DT_SPEC_GET(). `vin-supply`
 * names the shared daughter-connector rail (VDD_DAUGHTER, the `tpsm83102`
 * regulator) and is mandatory: the driver resolves it from devicetree at build
 * time (a missing `vin-supply` is a build error) and owns the regulator handle
 * directly, so none is passed in at run time. The driver validates the rail
 * voltage and enables the rail itself when acquisition starts. The MAX30101 INT
 * line is not a dedicated devicetree GPIO: it is wired to the daughter-board
 * connector and obtained at run time from the @ref senswear_daughter_if arbiter
 * (line ::daughter_if_GPIO1).
 *
 * @section senswear_max30101_lifecycle Driver lifecycle
 *
 * The expected lifecycle is:
 *
 * 1. Call max30101_init() to verify the shared bus, resolve and validate the
 *    devicetree supply rail, probe the part, and claim and configure the
 *    daughter-board interrupt line. The rail is enabled later, when acquisition
 *    starts.
 * 2. Call max30101_config() to apply the acquisition configuration (NULL selects
 *    the SensWear defaults).
 * 3. Start acquisition with max30101_enable_wrist_hr_sampling() or
 *    max30101_enable_sampling().
 * 4. On interrupt, call max30101_irq_handler() from thread context to decode the
 *    interrupt sources, drain the FIFO into the internal sample buffer, and
 *    publish events. When samples are drained the handler publishes
 *    ::max30101_event_FifoDataReady; its `v_param` carries the sample count and
 *    its `p_param` points at an array of ::max30101_sample_t held in the driver
 *    context. Consumers read the samples directly from that event payload.
 *
 * Initialization and configuration are deliberately separate. A successful probe
 * does not imply that the acquisition parameters have been applied.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30101_interrupts Interrupt and event model
 *
 * The driver does not depend on Bluetooth or any consumer subsystem. It only
 * decodes hardware activity into events and accumulates decoded samples in an
 * internal buffer that is republished with each ::max30101_event_FifoDataReady.
 *
 * The daughter-board interrupt callback posts ::max30101_Irq from ISR context.
 * A consumer then calls max30101_irq_handler() from thread context, which reads
 * the interrupt status registers, performs the action for each asserted source,
 * and publishes one decoded `max30101_event_*` identifier per source. When FIFO
 * data is drained the decoded samples are written to the internal buffer and
 * ::max30101_event_FifoDataReady is published with the sample count in `v_param`
 * and a pointer to the sample array in `p_param`. All events are delivered
 * through the shared @ref senswear_device_driver_events manager.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30101_example Typical usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * if (max30101_init() != 0) {
 *     // Sensor absent, bus unavailable, or interrupt line could not be claimed.
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * if (max30101_config(NULL) != 0) {
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * // false: interrupt once per FIFO almost-full batch; true: per sample.
 * max30101_enable_wrist_hr_sampling(false);
