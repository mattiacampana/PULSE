 *
 * The MTCH6102 is the touch controller on the SensWear touch daughter board.
 * It reports touch coordinates, touch-state flags, and gesture codes through
 * I2C. The driver probes the part, populates a default configuration object,
 * and uses the daughter-board connector arbiter for the INT and SYNC pins
 * rather than describing those pins directly in devicetree.
 *
 * Like the MAX30101 PPG driver, the MTCH6102 does not expose a per-driver
 * callback. Its INT-pin GPIO callback posts ::mtch6102_Irq from ISR context,
 * and a consumer calls mtch6102_irq_handler() from thread context to read the
 * touch/gesture state and publish decoded `mtch6102_event_*` identifiers through
 * the shared @ref senswear_device_driver_events manager:

 * @section senswear_mtch6102_devicetree Devicetree representation
 *
 * The controller is declared as a standard I2C child of the shared system bus:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * &sys_i2c_peripheral {
 *     mtch6102: mtch6102@25 {
 *         compatible = "senswear,daughter-i2c-device", "i2c-device";
 *         reg = <0x25>;
 *         label = "MTCH6102";
 *         vin-supply = <&tpsm83102>;
 *         status = "okay";
 *     };
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * The node is also wired into the board aliases `senswear-daughter` and
 * `senswear-touch`, both pointing at this instance.
 *
 * `reg` supplies the target address used by the I2C helper functions.
 * `vin-supply` names the shared daughter-connector rail (VDD_DAUGHTER, the
 * `tpsm83102` regulator) and is mandatory: like the DRV2605 and MAX30101 drivers
 * the MTCH6102 resolves the regulator from devicetree at build time (a missing
 * `vin-supply` is a build error) and owns the regulator handle directly, so none
 * is passed in at run time. The driver drives the rail to its fixed
 * ::MTCH6102_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_UV (2.8 V) and enables it when acquisition starts; an
 * already-live shared rail must already sit at that voltage. Keep this rail
 * enabled while the touch controller is in use: powering the MTCH6102 down can
 * leave the device holding the I2C bus until the rail is restored. The driver
 * resolves its INT and SYNC GPIOs at run time from the @ref senswear_daughter_if
 * arbiter, using `daughter_if_GPIO3` for INT and `daughter_if_GPIO2` for SYNC.
 * The MTCH6102 INT pin is open-collector, active-low; SYNC is an active-high
 * output, so the driver treats both connector lines as inputs and only arms an
 * interrupt on INT.
 *
 * @section senswear_mtch6102_lifecycle Driver lifecycle
 *
 * The expected lifecycle is:
 *
 * 1. Call mtch6102_init() to verify the shared bus, resolve and validate the
 *    devicetree supply rail, probe the controller, claim and configure the SYNC
 *    and INT lines, arm the INT interrupt, and populate the default
 *    configuration object. The rail is enabled later, when acquisition starts.
 * 2. Optionally adjust a mtch6102_config_t and pass it to mtch6102_config()
 *    to program the touch controller registers in one ownership scope.
 * 3. Call mtch6102_start() to power the supply rail. If the device has not yet
 *    been configured, start() applies the stored default config on demand
 *    first. The INT line is already armed by mtch6102_init(); with the rail
 *    powered the device begins asserting INT. Do not disable the rail while the
 *    driver is active: the MTCH6102 can hold the I2C bus in that state until the
 *    supply is restored.
 * 4. On every INT assertion the driver posts ::mtch6102_Irq from ISR context.
 *    A consumer then calls mtch6102_irq_handler() from thread context, which
 *    reads the touch position and gesture state, classifies the sample with
 *    mtch6102_sample_event(), and publishes the decoded `mtch6102_event_*`
 *    identifier through the shared device-event manager.
 * 5. Call mtch6102_stop() to power down the rail when finished.
 *
 * The INT line is armed once in mtch6102_init() and stays armed for the life of
 * the driver; acquisition is gated by the supply rail, which
 * mtch6102_start() powers and mtch6102_stop() removes. Keep the rail enabled
 * while the controller is connected to the bus; if the part is powered down it
 * may continue to hold the I2C lines until the rail is brought back up.
 *
 * @section senswear_mtch6102_events Interrupt and event model
 *
 * The driver does not depend on Bluetooth or any consumer subsystem, and it does
 * not expose a per-driver callback. It only turns INT-pin activity into stable
 * software events delivered through the shared
 * @ref senswear_device_driver_events manager.
 *
 * The daughter-board interrupt callback posts ::mtch6102_Irq from ISR context. A
 * consumer then calls mtch6102_irq_handler() from thread context, which reads the
 * touch/gesture state, classifies it, and publishes one decoded
 * `mtch6102_event_*` identifier. Each published event carries the raw
 * `TOUCH_STATE` byte in `v_param` and a pointer to the decoded
 * ::touch_sensor_sample (held in the driver context) in `p_param`.
 *
 * The driver exposes normalized event identifiers for raw interrupts, touch
 * state, and the gesture codes documented by the MTCH6102 user guide:
 *
 * - ::mtch6102_Irq is the raw INT pin assertion, posted from the ISR.
 * - ::mtch6102_event_TouchDetected and ::mtch6102_event_TouchReleased describe
 *   the raw touch-present bit in `TOUCH_STATE`.
 * - ::mtch6102_event_SingleClick, ::mtch6102_event_ClickAndHold,
 *   ::mtch6102_event_DoubleClick, ::mtch6102_event_DownSwipe,
 *   ::mtch6102_event_DownSwipeAndHold, ::mtch6102_event_RightSwipe,
 *   ::mtch6102_event_RightSwipeAndHold, ::mtch6102_event_UpSwipe,
 *   ::mtch6102_event_UpSwipeAndHold, ::mtch6102_event_LeftSwipe, and
 *   ::mtch6102_event_LeftSwipeAndHold map the MTCH6102 gesture codes.
 *
 * `mtch6102_sample_event()` classifies a decoded `struct touch_sensor_sample` into
 * one of those event identifiers, and `mtch6102_event_name()` returns a printable
 * name for logging or higher-level policy.
 *
 * @section senswear_mtch6102_config Configuration model
 *
 * The driver programs the MTCH6102 through one `mtch6102_config_t` object.
 * On the SensWear shield the touch surface is a single row of 15 pads, with
 * the last three pads routed to the Y axis; the default configuration keeps
 * that 12 X / 3 Y split explicit in the register block.
 * `mtch6102_config()` writes only the writable registers needed for touch and
 * gesture decoding, under one I2C ownership scope: the configuration register
 * block (NumberOfXChannels through VerticalGestureAngle, in register order),
 * the MODE and MODECON decode-control registers, and finally the CMD register
 * with the `cfg` bit set to apply the block. The read-only firmware-ID
 * (0x00-0x03) and touch/gesture status (0x10-0x15) registers are never written,
 * and the I2CAddr register is skipped so the device keeps its fixed address.
 *
 * `mtch6102_get_default_config()` fills the structure with the SensWear
 * defaults. Passing NULL to `mtch6102_config()` applies the same defaults.
 *
 * @section senswear_mtch6102_example Typical usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * if (mtch6102_init() != 0) {
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * if (mtch6102_config(NULL) != 0) {
 *     return;
 * }
 * mtch6102_start();
 *
 * // From the device-manager thread, in response to ::mtch6102_Irq:
 * mtch6102_irq_handler();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Legacy `touch_sensor_*` lifecycle entry points remain available as
 * compatibility wrappers for the current bridge code.
