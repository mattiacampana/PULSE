 * @brief SensWear MTCH6102 touch controller driver implementation.
 * @details The driver is a daughter-board singleton. Its connection is derived
 *          from `DT_ALIAS(senswear_touch)`, while all transfers are routed
 *          through @ref senswear_sys_i2c. Public hardware operations own the
 *          shared bus for their complete register sequence and finish with
 *          sys_i2c_release(). The INT and SYNC lines are claimed from the
 *          daughter-board GPIO arbiter so ownership stays centralized.
 *
 * Register helpers in this file intentionally do not lock. They may only be
 * called from a high-level operation that already owns the shared bus.
 *
 * The driver never reprograms the MTCH6102 I2C address: the address is fixed
 * by the devicetree `reg` property, and mtch6102_apply_config() skips the
 * I2CAddr configuration register so no configuration can move the device off
 * its default address.
 *
 * Like the MAX30101 PPG driver, the MTCH6102 does not expose a per-driver
 * callback. Its INT-pin GPIO callback posts ::mtch6102_Irq from ISR context, and
 * mtch6102_irq_handler() runs from thread context to read the touch/gesture
 * state and publish decoded events through the shared device-event manager. The
 * implementation is organized into explicit probe, GPIO, regulator,
 * configuration, event-classification, and interrupt sections so it reads like
 * the other SensWear board drivers.
