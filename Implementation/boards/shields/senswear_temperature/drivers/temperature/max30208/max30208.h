 * @ingroup io_interfaces
 * @{
 *
 * The MAX30208 is the digital temperature sensor on the SensWear temperature
 * daughter board. This driver probes the part, programs its acquisition
 * configuration (FIFO, interrupts, alarm thresholds, and GPIO modes), paces
 * single-shot conversions, and publishes decoded samples as driver-level events
 * on the shared device-event queue.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30208_timestamp_semantics Timestamp semantics
 *
 * The MAX30208 does not provide a Unix-epoch timestamp for FIFO records. The
 * driver timestamps each conversion with rtc_get_timestamp_us() when the sample
 * is drained. If multiple samples are present in one drain, they all share that
 * same conversion timestamp.
 *
 * Like the other SensWear board drivers, the MAX30208 routes every transfer
 * through the board's @ref senswear_sys_i2c ownership wrapper rather than
 * calling Zephyr's I2C API directly:
 *
 * @code{.text}
 * application / temperature bridge
 *          |
 *          | max30208_config(), max30208_start(), max30208_get_samples(), ...
 *          v
 * MAX30208 driver
 *          |
 *          | sys_i2c_lock(), transfer(s), sys_i2c_release()
 *          v
 * SensWear shared system I2C bus
 * @endcode
 *
 * Every high-level hardware operation acquires the shared bus once and calls
 * sys_i2c_release() on exit. Private register helpers assume that ownership has
 * already been acquired.
 *
 * Unlike the PPG daughter board, the temperature daughter board does not expose
 * a regulator or a daughter-connector interrupt line to this driver: the rail is
 * owned by the daughter-board manager and there is no hardware INT pin. The
 * driver therefore depends only on the shared system I2C bus and substitutes a
 * periodic software timer for the missing interrupt line.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30208_lifecycle Driver lifecycle
 *
 * 1. Call max30208_init() to verify the shared bus, probe the part, and load the
 *    SensWear default configuration into the driver context. A successful probe
 *    does not imply that the acquisition parameters have been written to the part.
 * 2. Call max30208_config() to apply the acquisition configuration (NULL selects
 *    the SensWear defaults). The defaults can be inspected or tailored through
 *    max30208_get_default_config(). This step is optional: max30208_start()
 *    applies the defaults automatically if the part has not been configured yet.
 * 3. Call max30208_start() to flush the internal buffer and begin pacing
 *    conversions; this publishes ::max30208_event_SamplingStarted.
 * 4. The driver's sampling timer fires at the configured rate and publishes
 *    ::max30208_TimerIrq from timer context.
 * 5. On ::max30208_TimerIrq the consumer calls max30208_get_samples(), which
 *    performs the conversion, appends it to the internal buffer, and publishes
 *    ::max30208_event_SampleReady (sample count in `v_param`, a pointer to the
 *    ::temperature_sample_t array in `p_param`). Each decoded sample gets the
 *    same conversion timestamp.
 * 6. Call max30208_stop() / max30208_deinit() to halt.
 *
 * Initialization and configuration are deliberately separate: programming the
 * acquisition registers is driven by max30208_config() rather than the probe in
 * max30208_init().
 *
 * @section senswear_max30208_config Acquisition configuration
 *
 * struct max30208_config_t gathers the register bit-field overlays the driver
 * programs during max30208_config(): the INTERRUPT_ENABLE selection, the
 * FIFO_CONFIG1 almost-full threshold, the FIFO_CONFIG2 roll-over / almost-full /
 * status-clear options, the GPIO_SETUP pin modes, and the high/low temperature
 * alarm thresholds. It is a software datatype, not a raw register image; each
 * member is written to its corresponding register under one shared-bus ownership
 * scope. max30208_get_default_config() fills the structure with the SensWear
 * defaults (overridable through max30208_config.h), which is the same
 * configuration applied when max30208_config() is called with NULL.
 *
 * @section senswear_max30208_events Event model
 *
 * The driver does not depend on any consumer subsystem; it only paces hardware
 * activity into events delivered through the shared
 * @ref senswear_device_driver_events manager:
 *
 * - ::max30208_TimerIrq is posted from the sampling timer each period.
 * - ::max30208_event_SampleReady is posted by max30208_get_samples() when a
 *   conversion completes, carrying the decoded samples in its payload.
 * - ::max30208_event_SamplingStarted / ::max30208_event_SamplingStopped bracket
 *   an acquisition session.
