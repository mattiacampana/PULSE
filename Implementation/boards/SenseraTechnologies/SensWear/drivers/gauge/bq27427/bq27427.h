 * @{
 *
 * The BQ27427 is an Impedance Track gas gauge that reports battery voltage,
 * current, temperature, state of charge, and remaining/full capacity for the
 * SensWear main board. The driver programs the gauge's design parameters
 * (capacity, energy, chemistry, current thresholds) into data flash and then
 * reads the decoded battery state on demand.
 *
 * Timestamp values in this driver are sampled from `SYS_CLOCK_REALTIME` through
 * `rtc_get_timestamp_us()`, are expressed as Unix epoch time in microseconds
 * since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`, and truncate the sub-microsecond portion of
 * the clock.
 *
 * Unlike the @ref senswear_bq25180 charger, this driver talks to the device
 * directly through Zephyr's I2C API using an I2C_DT_SPEC_GET() specification:
 *

 * @endcode
 *
 * @section senswear_bq27427_devicetree Devicetree representation
 *
 * The gauge is a standard child of the I2C controller. The driver resolves it
 * through DT_NODELABEL(bq27427), so the node must use that label:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * bq27427: fuel-gauge@55 {
 *     compatible = "senswear,bq27427";
 *     reg = <0x55>;
 *     int-gpios = <&gpio1 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
 *     status = "okay";
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * `reg` supplies the target address used by I2C_DT_SPEC_GET(). The `int-gpios`
 * (GAUGE_IRQ) property is declared for the GPOUT/SOC_INT line but is not yet
 * consumed by the current implementation; battery state is polled.
 *
 * @section senswear_bq27427_lifecycle Driver lifecycle
 *
 * The expected lifecycle is:
 *
 * 1. Call bq27427_init() to resolve the devicetree specification, verify the
 *    bus, probe the DeviceType register, and seed the default configuration.
 * 2. Prepare a struct bq27427_config_t, typically via
 *    bq27427_get_default_config().
 * 3. Call bq27427_config() to unseal the gauge, program the design parameters
 *    into data flash, and re-seal it.
 * 4. Call bq27427_update_state() periodically to read the latest battery state.
 *
 * @warning Configuration is a long, blocking operation. Unsealing, entering
 *          CONFIG UPDATE mode, programming data flash, and re-inserting the
 *          battery involve multiple multi-second k_msleep() delays, so
 *          bq27427_config() and bq27427_reset() must be called from a context
 *          where blocking for several seconds is acceptable.
 *
 * @section senswear_bq27427_example Typical usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * struct bq27427_config_t config;
 * struct bq27427_battery_state_t state;
 *
 * if (!bq27427_init()) {
 *     // Gauge absent or bus unavailable.
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * bq27427_get_default_config(&config);
 *
 * if (!bq27427_config(&config)) {
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * if (bq27427_update_state(&state)) {
 *     int soc = state.state_of_charge; // tenths of a percent
 *     (void)soc;
