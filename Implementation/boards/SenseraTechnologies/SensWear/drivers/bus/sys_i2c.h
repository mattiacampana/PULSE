 * @brief Ownership-locking access to the SensWear shared system I2C bus.
 *
 * @defgroup senswear_sys_i2c SensWear shared system I2C bus
 * @ingroup io_interfaces
 * @{
 *
 * The SensWear main board routes several devices through one physical I2C
 * controller. Device drivers may require different controller settings and may
 * perform multi-transfer operations that must not be interleaved with transfers
 * from another device.
 *
 * `sys_i2c` therefore sits between board device drivers and Zephyr's I2C API:
 *
 * @code{.text}
 * board device driver
 *        |
 *        | sys_i2c_lock(), transfer(s), sys_i2c_unlock()
 *        v
 * sys_i2c ownership wrapper
 *        |
 *        | i2c_configure(), i2c_write(), i2c_read()
 *        v
 * Zephyr I2C controller
 * @endcode
 *
 * Each consumer owns a persistent struct sys_i2c_dt_spec. The address and bus
 * configuration stored inside that object identify the consumer. In particular,
 * the address of `spec->config` is used as the ownership token.
 *
 * @section senswear_sys_i2c_contract Locking contract
 *
 * A high-level driver operation must:
 *
 * 1. Call sys_i2c_lock() before its first transfer.
 * 2. Keep the lock for the complete atomic register sequence.
 * 3. Use only sys_i2c_write(), sys_i2c_read(), or sys_i2c_write_read().
 * 4. Call sys_i2c_unlock() exactly once on every path after a successful lock.
 *
 * Locking is recursive for the owning thread when every nested acquisition uses
 * the same spec. Each successful lock must have a matching unlock. Ownership is
 * released only by the final unlock:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * sys_i2c_lock(&charger_i2c, K_FOREVER); // depth 1
 * sys_i2c_lock(&charger_i2c, K_FOREVER); // depth 2
 * sys_i2c_unlock(&charger_i2c);          // depth 1, still owned
 * sys_i2c_unlock(&charger_i2c);          // depth 0, released
 * @endcode
 *
 * A thread may not acquire a different consumer spec while it recursively owns
 * the wrapper. Other threads block on the mutex until the complete nested lock
 * chain is released.
 *
 * @section senswear_sys_i2c_devicetree Devicetree representation
 *
 * The shared wrapper references the physical controller:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * sys_i2c: sys_i2c {
 *     compatible = "senswear,sys-i2c";
 *     controller = <&i2c21>;
 *     status = "okay";
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Consumers retain the standard Zephyr I2C hierarchy:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * &i2c21 {
 * charger: charger@6a {
 *     compatible = "vendor,charger";
 *     reg = <0x6a>;
 *     status = "okay";
 * };
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * The physical parent and `reg` remain available to standard Zephyr tooling.
 * Board drivers construct a sys_i2c spec to enforce ownership while performing
 * transfers through the wrapper.
 *
 * @section senswear_sys_i2c_example Typical usage
 *
 * The DT spec must have static or otherwise stable lifetime because its embedded
 * configuration object is the ownership token.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * #define CHARGER_NODE DT_NODELABEL(charger)
 *
 * static const struct sys_i2c_dt_spec charger_i2c =
 *     SYS_I2C_DT_SPEC_GET(CHARGER_NODE);
 *
 * static int charger_read_register(uint8_t reg, uint8_t *value)
 * {
 *     int ret;
 *
 *     ret = sys_i2c_lock(&charger_i2c, K_MSEC(100));
 *     if (ret != 0) {
 *         return ret;
 *     }
 *
 *     ret = sys_i2c_write_read(&charger_i2c, &reg, sizeof(reg),
 *                              value, sizeof(*value));
 *
 *     // Always release ownership after a successful lock.
 *     int unlock_ret = sys_i2c_unlock(&charger_i2c);
 *     return ret != 0 ? ret : unlock_ret;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * A multi-register transaction uses one lock for the entire sequence:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * static int charger_configure(void)
 * {
 *     const uint8_t first[] = {REG_A, VALUE_A};
 *     const uint8_t second[] = {REG_B, VALUE_B};
 *     int ret;
 *
 *     ret = sys_i2c_lock(&charger_i2c, K_MSEC(100));
 *     if (ret != 0) {
 *         return ret;
 *     }
 *
 *     ret = sys_i2c_write(&charger_i2c, first, sizeof(first));
 *     if (ret == 0) {
 *         ret = sys_i2c_write(&charger_i2c, second, sizeof(second));
 *     }
 *
 *     int unlock_ret = sys_i2c_unlock(&charger_i2c);
 *     return ret != 0 ? ret : unlock_ret;
 * }
 * @endcode
