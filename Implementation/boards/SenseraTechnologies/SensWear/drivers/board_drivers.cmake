# SensWear board driver aggregation.
#
# Each driver type provides a <type>_drivers.cmake that appends its enabled
# sources and public include directories to BOARD_DRIVER_SOURCES and
# BOARD_DRIVER_INCLUDE_DIRS. The collected lists are exposed to the application
# through the `board_drivers` INTERFACE library.
