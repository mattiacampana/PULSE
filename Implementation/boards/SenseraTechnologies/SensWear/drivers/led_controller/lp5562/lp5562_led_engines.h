 * This header holds the functional model of the LP5562 program engines: the LED
 * and engine identifiers, the per-engine state/mode model, and the bit-accurate
 * representation of the LP5562 program-engine instruction set (ramp, wait,
 * set-PWM, branch, end, trigger).
 *
 * The instruction builders are pure: they perform @b no I2C and instead return
 * the corresponding register object (the command @c union) by value. Callers
 * hand those objects to the @ref lp5562.h driver functions, which serialize them
 * into engine program memory over I2C. This separates @e what to run (these
 * builders) from @e how it reaches the device (the driver).
 *
 * The implementations live in @c lp5562_led_engine.c; the raw register map is in
 * @ref lp5562_registers.h.
