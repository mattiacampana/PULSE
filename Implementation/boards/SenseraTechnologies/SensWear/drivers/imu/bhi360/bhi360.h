 * @brief SensWear BHI360 smart IMU driver API.
 *
 * @defgroup senswear_bhi360 SensWear BHI360 smart IMU
 * @ingroup io_interfaces
 * @{
 *
 * The BHI360 is a 6-axis inertial sensor with integrated firmware that fuses
 * accelerometer, gyroscope, and optional magnetometer data to produce virtual
 * sensors: quaternion orientation, linear acceleration, gravity compensation,
 * step detection, gesture recognition, and activity classification. The device
 * communicates via SPI and generates interrupts on its INT pins when FIFO data
 * becomes available.
 *
 * The driver operates in interrupt-driven mode: GPIO callbacks post raw IRQ
 * events to the central device-driver event queue (see @ref
 * device_driver_events.h). The application consumes those events from thread
 * context, calls bhi360_irq_handler(), and then consumes decoded sensor/meta
 * events posted by the parser callbacks.
 *
 * @section senswear_bhi360_timestamp_semantics Timestamp semantics
 *
 * Sensor payload timestamps come from the BHY2 FIFO parser callback data. The
 * @c time_stamp value in @c struct bhy2_fifo_parse_data_info is the BHI360
 * firmware's raw FIFO tick counter, measured in 15.625 us ticks since sensor
 * boot. The driver converts that counter to elapsed microseconds before storing
 * it in the payload structs below. These values are not Unix-epoch timestamps.
 * The driver also records a host-minus-sensor offset at IRQ entry for internal
 * time alignment; the payload timestamps themselves remain sensor-boot-relative.
 *
 * IRQ timestamps captured by the driver itself use rtc_get_timestamp_ms() and
 * therefore are milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
 *
 * @section senswear_bhi360_event_model Event-driven architecture
 *
 * The BHI360 posts the following event types (see @ref bhi360_event_type):
 *
 * - **Irq**: Raw interrupt signal. The application/caller thread should call
 *   bhi360_irq_handler() to read and parse FIFO data, which may generate zero or
 *   more downstream decoded events.
 *
 * - **QuaternionBatch**: A batch of orientation samples (x, y, z, w, accuracy).
 *   @details Posted once per FIFO drain, not per sample. v_param carries the number
 *   of samples collected during the drain; p_param points at the first of that many
 *   contiguous @c struct bhi360_quat_data_t (oldest first). Source: Game rotation
 *   vector wake-up sensor at 100 Hz. The pointed-to array is valid only until
 *   the next drain; bhi360_copy_quaternion() returns a thread-safe snapshot.
 *
 * - **LinearAccelerationBatch**: A batch of X, Y, Z acceleration samples.
 *   @details Posted once per FIFO drain, not per sample. v_param carries the number
 *   of samples; p_param points at that many contiguous @c struct bhi360_lacc_data_t
 *   (oldest first). Source: Accelerometer wake-up sensor at 100 Hz. Valid until
 *   the next drain; bhi360_copy_linear_acceleration() returns a thread-safe snapshot.
 *
 * - **GyroBatch**: A batch of angular velocity X, Y, Z samples.
 *   @details Posted once per FIFO drain, not per sample. v_param carries the number
 *   of samples; p_param points at that many contiguous @c struct bhi360_gyro_data_t
 *   (oldest first). Source: Gyroscope wake-up (GYRO_WU) sensor at 100 Hz. Valid
 *   until the next drain; bhi360_copy_gyro() returns a thread-safe snapshot.
 *
 * - **Pedometer**: Step count and detection state.
 *   @details Sensor ID passed in v_param; data via p_param
 *   (@c struct bhi360_pedometer_data_t*). Source: Step counter low-power (STC_LP)
 *   at 1 Hz. @c timestamp is derived from the BHY2 callback timestamp and is
 *   stored as elapsed microseconds since BHI360 firmware boot. The current
 *   default firmware does not advertise the wake-up low-power step
 *   counter/detector IDs.
 *
 * - **Gesture**: Gesture type and sensor ID.
 *   @details Sensor ID and gesture value packed in v_param as (sensor_id << 8) | value;
 *   data via p_param (@c struct bhi360_gesture_data_t*). Sources: No Motion LP
 *   wake-up, Wrist Gesture Detect LP wake-up, and Wrist Wear LP wake-up.
 *   @c timestamp is derived from the BHY2 callback timestamp and is stored as
 *   elapsed microseconds since BHI360 firmware boot. The current default
 *   firmware does not advertise Any Motion LP wake-up or Significant Motion LP
 *   wake-up.
 *
 * - **Activity**: Activity classification with start/end flags.
 *   @details Sensor ID and activity bits packed in v_param as (sensor_id << 16) | activity;
 *   data via p_param (@c struct bhi360_activity_data_t*). Activity bits indicate
 *   which activity started/ended (still, walking, running, bicycle, vehicle,
 *   tilting). @c timestamp is derived from the BHY2 callback timestamp and is
 *   stored as elapsed microseconds since BHI360 firmware boot. Sources:
 *   Activity Recognition Wear (AR_WEAR_WU) at 1 Hz.
 *
 * - **MetaEvent**: Actionable firmware-generated metadata (sensor mode, reset,
 *   calibration, errors, overflow, etc.).
 *   @details Packed in v_param as (type << 16) | (byte1 << 8) | byte2;
 *   no p_param. Includes events: flush complete, sample rate changed, power mode
 *   changed, algorithm events, sensor status, BSX steps, sensor errors, FIFO
 *   overflow, dynamic range changed, watermark, initialization, transfer cause,
 *   sensor framework, and reset notifications. Routine spacer and initialized
 *   notifications are consumed by the driver and not posted to the application
 *   queue.
 *
 * @section senswear_bhi360_devicetree Devicetree representation
 *
 * The BHI360 is declared with its INT pins and SPI bus specification:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * bhi360: bhi360@1 {
 *     compatible = "bosch,bhi360";
 *     reg = <1>;
 *     spi-max-frequency = <8000000>;
 *     cs-gpios = <&gpio2 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
 *     int-gpios = <&gpio1 9 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
 *     reset-gpios = <&gpio2 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
 *     gpio0-gpios = <&gpio1 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
 *     gpio1-gpios = <&gpio2 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
 *     status = "okay";
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * `int-gpios` is the active-low host IRQ. `gpio0-gpios` routes the BHI360 ASDX
 * pin to nRF54L15 P1.10, and `gpio1-gpios` routes the BHI360 ASCX pin to P2.06.
 * These auxiliary pins are exposed to callers through bhi360_get_gpio0() and
 * bhi360_get_gpio1() for custom BHI360 firmware use. Because GPIO0 is on nRF54L15
 * Port 1, it is better suited as an output strobe. GPIO1 is better suited as an
 * MPU input for custom firmware triggers.
 *
 * @section senswear_bhi360_lifecycle Driver lifecycle
 *
 * The expected lifecycle is:
 *
 * 1. Call bhi360_init() to verify the shared SPI/GPIO resources and initialize
 *    interrupt handlers.
 * 2. Call bhi360_config() to bind the BHY2 transport hooks, probe the
 *    product ID, upload firmware, configure FIFO/host interrupt routing, and
 *    enable the configured low-rate activity-class event sensors.
 * 3. Start high-rate physical streams later by calling
 *    bhi360_start_phy_sensor_streams().
 * 4. Process BHI360 device events as they arrive via the event queue. On each
 *    bhi360_event_Irq, call bhi360_irq_handler() from caller thread context.
 * 5. Use bhi360_stop_phy_sensor_streams() to stop only the high-rate physical
 *    streams; low-rate event sensors remain configured.
 * 6. Call bhi360_stop() to disable all configured virtual sensors and soft-reset
 *    the device.
 *
 * @section senswear_bhi360_sensors Configured Sensors
 *
 * The driver uses two requested sensor groups.
 * Sensor availability is firmware-dependent: bhi360_config() only enables
 * sensors advertised by the loaded BHI360 firmware. If the firmware image is
 * changed, update these requested sensor tables to match the virtual sensors
 * exposed by that firmware.
 *
 * **Physical stream sensors** (100 Hz sample rate, optional):
 * - Game Rotation Vector wake-up (GAMERV_WU): Fused orientation as quaternion
 *   (x, y, z, w, accuracy).
 * - Accelerometer wake-up (ACC_WU): Acceleration.
 * - Gyroscope wake-up (GYRO_WU): Angular velocity.
 *
 * The high-rate streams intentionally use wake-up virtual-sensor IDs so their
 * samples are placed in the wake FIFO. They are enabled only when
 * bhi360_start_phy_sensor_streams(period_ms) is called after configuration.
 * They are disabled by bhi360_stop_phy_sensor_streams() without disabling the
 * low-rate event sensors.
 *
 * The wake and non-wake FIFO watermarks are both programmed to 8 bytes during
 * bhi360_config() so host interrupts are generated after small batches
 * instead of waiting for firmware default watermarks.
 *
 * **Activity-class event sensors** (configured by bhi360_config()):
 * - Step Counter LP (STC_LP): Cumulative low-power step count.
 * - Step Detector LP (STD_LP): Step-detected events.
 * - Any Motion LP (ANY_MOTION_LP): Low-power motion event.
 * - No Motion LP wake-up (NO_MOTION_LP_WU): Wake-up no-motion event.
 * - Wrist Gesture Detect LP wake-up, Wrist Wear LP wake-up.
 * - Activity Recognition Wear (AR_WEAR_WU): Wake-up variant for detecting
 *   when user activity changes.
 *
 * Each configured entry provides its own sample rate and report latency. Step
 * Counter LP, Step Detector LP, and Any Motion LP are non-wake streams in the
 * current firmware, so the non-wake FIFO watermark is also kept small.
 *
 * **Meta-Events** (firmware-generated, always enabled):
 * - Flush complete, sample rate changed, power mode changed, algorithm events,
 *   sensor status, BSX calibration steps, sensor errors, FIFO overflow,
 *   dynamic range changed, watermark, firmware initialization (boot/reset
 *   complete), transfer cause, sensor framework, and reset notifications. Only
 *   routine spacer (FIFO padding) packets are filtered in the driver.
