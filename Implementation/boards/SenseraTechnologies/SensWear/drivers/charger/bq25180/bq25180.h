 * @brief SensWear BQ25180 charger and power-path controller API.
 *
 * @defgroup senswear_bq25180 SensWear BQ25180 charger
 * @ingroup io_interfaces
 * @{
 *
 * The BQ25180 manages battery charging, input-current limiting, battery
 * protection thresholds, power-path behavior, ship mode, and shutdown behavior
 * for the SensWear main board. It also exposes a cached charger-state
 * snapshot and the most recent interrupt timestamp for policy code that needs
 * to react to charger events.
 *
 * Timestamp values in this driver are captured from `SYS_CLOCK_REALTIME` via
 * `rtc_get_timestamp_us()`, are expressed as Unix epoch time in microseconds
 * since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`, and truncate the sub-microsecond portion of
 * the clock.
 *
 * The driver uses the board's @ref senswear_sys_i2c ownership wrapper rather
 * than calling Zephyr's I2C API directly:
 *
 * @code{.text}
 * application / power manager
 *          |
 *          | bq25180_config(), bq25180_update_state(), ...
 *          v
 * BQ25180 driver
 *          |
 *          | sys_i2c_lock(), transfer(s), sys_i2c_release()
 *          v
 * SensWear shared system I2C bus
 * @endcode
 *
 * Every high-level hardware operation acquires the shared bus once and calls
 * sys_i2c_release() on exit. Private register helpers assume that ownership has
 * already been acquired.
 *
 * @section senswear_bq25180_devicetree Devicetree representation
 *
 * The charger remains a standard child of the physical I2C controller:
 *
 * @code{.dts}
 * sys_i2c_peripheral: &i2c21 {
 *     bq25180: charger@6a {
 *         compatible = "senswear,bq25180";
 *         reg = <0x6a>;
 *         int-gpios = <&gpio1 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
 *         kill-gpios = <&gpio1 8 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
 *         status = "okay";
 *     };
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * `reg` supplies the target address used by SYS_I2C_DT_SPEC_GET(). The
 * interrupt GPIO is also read from this node. `kill-gpios` is reserved for
 * power-hold control but is not yet consumed by the current implementation.
 *
 * @section senswear_bq25180_lifecycle Driver lifecycle
 *
 * The expected lifecycle is:
 *
 * 1. Call bq25180_init() to verify the shared bus and probe the charger.
 * 2. Prepare a struct bq25180_config_t using one of the default helpers.
 * 3. Call bq25180_config() to program the device registers.
 * 4. Call bq25180_update_state() in response to IRQs or whenever the decoded
 *    charger state needs to be refreshed.
 * 5. Use bq25180_enable_charging(), the power-mode operations, and
 *    bq25180_get_last_irq_timestamp_ms() as required.
 *
 * Initialization and configuration are deliberately separate. A successful
 * probe does not imply that the desired battery parameters have been applied.
 *
 * @section senswear_bq25180_example Typical usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * struct bq25180_config_t config;
 * union bq25180_charger_state_t state;
 *
 * if (!bq25180_init()) {
 *     // Charger absent or shared bus unavailable.
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * bq25180_get_default_lipo_usb_charger_config(&config);
 * config.battery_uvlo = bq25180_battery_UVLO_threshold_2V8;
 *
 * if (!bq25180_config(&config)) {
 *     return;
 * }
 *
 * if (bq25180_update_state(&state) == 0) {
 *     bool may_charge = state.state.bits.bPowerGood && !state.state.bits.bCharged;
 *     (void)bq25180_enable_charging(may_charge);
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section senswear_bq25180_interrupts Interrupt status
 *
 * The GPIO callback for `int-gpios` posts bq25180_event_InterruptDetected from
 * ISR context. Call bq25180_update_state() from thread context to read the IC,
 * refresh the cached decoded state, and publish state-change events. The
 * returned snapshot stores the refresh time in microseconds since the Unix
 * epoch, and bq25180_get_last_irq_timestamp_ms() exposes the most recent IRQ
 * timestamp captured in the callback.
