 * @{
 *
 * The daughter-board connector exposes four shared GPIO lines (SENSOR_GPIO_0..3)
 * that different daughter-board drivers (haptic, PPG, temperature, touch, ...)
 * may want to use for their own signals — interrupts, resets, mode pins, etc.
 * Because only one daughter board is fitted at a time and each board assigns the
 * lines differently, this module @b aggregates the connector lines in one place
 * and arbitrates which driver controls each line.
 *
 * @section senswear_daughter_if_model Ownership model
 *
 * Each line has a single owner slot. A driver calls daughter_if_gpio_claim() for
 * the line it wants and receives the line's @ref gpio_dt_spec to configure and
 * drive — but only when the line is free. Possession of that returned non-NULL
 * pointer @e is the ownership: a second driver that claims the same line gets
 * NULL, so two drivers can never hold the same pin. daughter_if_gpio_release()
 * returns the line to the free pool.
 *
 * This is a @b runtime arbiter: ownership is resolved while the program runs, so
 * it naturally supports hot daughter-board changes and probe-order independence.
 * The check is serialized with a mutex and is safe to call from thread context.
 *
 * @section senswear_daughter_if_usage Typical usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * const struct gpio_dt_spec *irq = daughter_if_gpio_claim(daughter_if_gpio_0);
 *
 * if (irq != NULL) {
 *     gpio_pin_configure_dt(irq, GPIO_INPUT);
 *     // ... use the line ...
 *     daughter_if_gpio_release(daughter_if_gpio_0);
 * }
