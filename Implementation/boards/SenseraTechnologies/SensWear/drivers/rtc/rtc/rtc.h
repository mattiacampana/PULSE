 * @{
 *
 * The nRF54L15 has no battery-backed calendar RTC peripheral; its only
 * always-on time source is the GRTC, which already backs Zephyr's system clock.
 * This driver therefore does not talk to a dedicated RTC chip. Instead it is a
 * thin facade over the kernel wall clock (@ref SYS_CLOCK_REALTIME), which is
 * exactly the time base that POSIX `time()`, `gmtime_r()`, and
 * `clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ...)` read:
 *
 * @code{.text}
 * application                       POSIX time(), gmtime_r(), clock_gettime()
 *      |                                       |
 *      | rtc_set_time(), rtc_get_time()        | reads SYS_CLOCK_REALTIME

 * SensWear rtc facade  --- sys_clock_settime(SYS_CLOCK_REALTIME) ---> kernel
 *      |        \                                                       wall
 *      |         \--- NVS (settings) persistence -> restored at boot     clock
 *      v
 * k_timer alarms (minute / hour / day / specific-time)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Because the driver writes the wall clock through sys_clock_settime(), every
 * POSIX time call returns the value last programmed through rtc_set_time(),
 * advanced by the system clock. No periodic polling is performed for
 * timekeeping itself.
 *
 * @section senswear_rtc_persistence Persistence
 *
 * The current Unix time is saved to the Settings/NVS backend on every
 * rtc_set_time() and periodically every ::RTC_PERSIST_INTERVAL_SEC seconds. At
 * rtc_init() the most recent saved value is restored so the wall clock survives
 * a reboot to within the persist interval. Time cannot survive battery removal:
 * with no hardware RTC there is nothing to keep counting while unpowered. When
 * no value has ever been saved, the clock starts at ::RTC_DEFAULT_UNIX.
 *
 * @section senswear_rtc_alarms Alarms
 *
 * Alarms are backed by `k_timer` objects, whose timeouts the kernel turns into
 * GRTC hardware compares. The SoC therefore sleeps (System-ON idle) between
 * boundaries and wakes once per event rather than polling. Three recurring
 * boundary alarms and one one-shot alarm are provided:
 *
 * - rtc_enable_minute_alarm() fires at every wall-clock `:00` second.
 * - rtc_enable_hour_alarm()   fires at every wall-clock `:00:00`.
 * - rtc_enable_day_alarm()    fires at every wall-clock `00:00:00` UTC.
 * - rtc_set_time_alarm()      fires once at a specific UTC time.
 *
 * Each firing publishes a ::rtc_event_type through the SensWear device-event
 * manager from interrupt context; process it from the consumer thread.
 *
 * @note Alarms do not wake the SoC from System-OFF (deepest sleep). That would
 *       require a GRTC extended channel (z_nrf_grtc_timer_ext_chan_alloc()) and
 *       is intentionally out of scope here.
 *
 * @section senswear_rtc_time_repr Time representation
 *
 * Broken-down time uses the standard `struct tm` in UTC. Unix time is exposed
 * in seconds through `rtc_get_unix()`. For data streams that need sub-second
 * epoch tags, `rtc_get_timestamp_ms()` and `rtc_get_timestamp_us()` return Unix
 * timestamps in milliseconds and microseconds.
 *
 * @section senswear_rtc_example Typical usage
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * struct tm now = {
 *     .tm_year = 2026 - 1900, .tm_mon = 5, .tm_mday = 29,
 *     .tm_hour = 12, .tm_min = 0, .tm_sec = 0,
 * };
 *
 * rtc_init();
 * rtc_set_time(&now);          // wall clock + POSIX time() now agree
 * rtc_enable_minute_alarm(true);
 *
 * // From the device-event consumer thread:
 * //   case RTC0_DEVICE_DTS_ID:
 * //       if (ev.event_id == rtc_event_MinuteAlarm) { ... }
 * @endcode
