 * The PPG BLE service publishes MAX30101 samples that arrive through the device
 * manager's PPG zbus stream. The service does not call the MAX30101 driver
 * directly for data and does not own a worker thread. Runtime acquisition
 * control is exposed through a separate configuration service; writes are
 * forwarded to the device manager.
 *
 * @section senswear_ble_ppg_payloads Payload units
 *
 * Each PPG characteristic reports a single channel as a timestamp/value pair.
 * @c unix_ms is milliseconds since the Unix epoch. @c value is the raw
 * right-justified 18-bit ADC count from the MAX30101 channel.
