 * Bring-up test for the SensWear MTCH6102 touch driver on the senswear_touch
 * shield.
 *
 * The MTCH6102 sits on the daughter-board connector, so it owns the TPSM83102
 * (VDD_DAUGHTER) rail through its devicetree vin-supply phandle; the driver
 * powers that rail itself when acquisition starts. The test brings the
 * controller up through the driver lifecycle:
 *
 *   mtch6102_init()   - verify the shared bus, validate the rail, probe the
 *                       firmware ID, claim the daughter_if INT/SYNC lines, and
 *                       arm the INT interrupt
 *   mtch6102_config() - apply the SensWear default configuration (NULL =
 *                       defaults); the I2C address register is never written
 *   mtch6102_start()  - power the rail; the INT line is already armed, so the
 *                       device begins asserting INT on touch
 *
 * Acquisition is interrupt driven. The MTCH6102 INT line posts ::mtch6102_Irq
 * from ISR context; a dedicated consumer thread drains the shared device-event
 * queue and, on that event, calls mtch6102_irq_handler() to read the touch and
 * gesture state. The handler classifies the sample and publishes a decoded
 * `mtch6102_event_*` identifier, carrying the raw TOUCH_STATE byte in `v_param`
 * and a pointer to the decoded ::touch_sensor_sample in `p_param`, which the
 * consumer prints. This mirrors the consumer-thread structure used by the
 * tests/shields MAX30101 bring-up test.
 *
 * As a bench fallback (in case the INT line is not wired on the rig) the handler
 * is also polled whenever the event wait times out; it republishes a decoded
 * event so the test still makes progress.
 *
 * Build with the `test_mtch6102` preset (which also enables the shield); see
 * tests/shields/README.md.
