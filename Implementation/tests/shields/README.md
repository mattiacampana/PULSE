# Shield driver bring-up tests

Standalone, on-target bring-up tests for drivers shipped by a SensWear shield —
one `main_test_<driver>.c` per shield driver. Each file defines its own `main()`
and exercises a single driver, mirroring `tests/drivers` but for shield-scoped
drivers (which also require the shield to be enabled).

| File | Driver | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `main_test_drv2605.c` | DRV2605 haptics (senswear_haptic shield) | check haptics ready → configure/play an RTP amplitude ramp → wait 2 s → configure/play ROM LRA effect 1 → wait 2 s |
| `main_test_max30101.c` | MAX30101 PPG (senswear_ppg shield) | power VDD_DAUGHTER (5.0 V) → probe and configure → start wrist-HR sampling → drain interrupt-driven IR/Red/Green samples with IRQ-anchored timestamps from the internal stream |
| `main_test_max30208.c` | MAX30208 temperature (senswear_temperature shield) | probe and configure the FIFO → start timer-paced sampling → drain temperature samples from the internal stream on each `max30208_TimerIrq`, stamped at the conversion time |
| `main_test_mtch6102.c` | MTCH6102 touch (senswear_touch shield) | verify the shared bus → probe and configure (defaults) → start acquisition → drain interrupt-driven touch/gesture events and print the decoded position on each `mtch6102_Irq` |

## Building a test

Like `tests/drivers`, tests are selected with **Kconfig symbols** (all off by
default) so a normal build is unaffected, and they are Kconfig — not CMake
options — so the selection propagates through sysbuild / a CMake preset.

- `CONFIG_SENSWEAR_TEST_<DRIVER>_DRIVER` — build that driver's test, e.g.
  `CONFIG_SENSWEAR_TEST_DRV2605_DRIVER`.

Because the driver belongs to a shield, the shield must also be enabled so its
devicetree node and driver are present. The easiest way is the matching CMake
preset, which enables both:

```sh
cmake --preset test_drv2605
cmake --build --preset test_drv2605
```

For the fitted VG0625002U, the DRV2605 test should report a detected DRV2605L,
`260 Hz`, `RATED_VOLTAGE=0x1b`, `OD_CLAMP=0x2f`, `DRIVE_TIME=0x0e`, and a passed
auto-calibration before playback starts.

Equivalently:

```sh
west build -b SensWear/nrf54l15/cpuapp -- \
    -DSHIELD=senswear_haptic \
    -DCONFIG_SENSWEAR_TEST_DRV2605_DRIVER=y
```

Enable exactly **one** bring-up test across `tests/drivers` and `tests/shields`
(each defines its own `main()`; the build fails fast if two are on). When a test
is enabled, the application main (`src/main.c`) is omitted and the test's
`main()` takes its place.

Wiring: the top `CMakeLists.txt` reads the `CONFIG_SENSWEAR_TEST_*` symbols,
derives `TEST_SHIELDS`, and includes `tests/shields/tests.cmake` when it is on;
that file creates a `test_<driver>` INTERFACE library per enabled test and links
it into `app`.
